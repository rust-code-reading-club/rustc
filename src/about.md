# What is this?

[rustc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
[code reading club]: https://code-reading.org/
[CRC Google Calendar]: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dWp0NHRyNWVnZnNtZWNvMGU1cGkxbjk0ZDRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

Have you ever wanted to understand how [rustc] works? **This club is for you!** Inspired by the very cool [Code Reading Club], the idea is to get together every few weeks and just spend some time reading the code in [rustc] or other related projects.

The way this club works is pretty simple: every other week, we'll get together for 90 minutes and read some part of [rustc] (or some project related to [rustc]), and talk about it. Our goal is to walk away with a high-level understanding of how that code works. For more complex parts of the code, we may wind up spending multiple sessions on the same code.

We'll be following a "semi-structured" reading process:

* Identify the modules in the code and their purpose.
* Look at the type definitions and try to describe their high-level purpose.
* Identify the most important functions and their purpose.
* Dig into how a few of those functions are actually implemented.

The meetings will *not* be recorded, but they will be open to anyone. The first meeting of the Rustc Reading Club will be **November 4th, 2021 at 12:00pm US Eastern time**. Hope to see you there! ([Link to Google Calendar][CRC Google Calendar])
